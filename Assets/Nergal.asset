  charBio: The gods have always been cautious about Nergal and their pestilent area
    of effect powers, but when all power is necessary, Nergal is sent to the frontlines
    to unleash their lethal plagues upon the enemy. The Mesopotamian deity of war
    and disease, many death gods cower in fear of their virtually limitless power,
    though Nergal themselves has only expressed interest in using their power against
    those that threaten any of the afterlifes. Equipped with deadly plague powers,
    Nergal can wipe an entire battlefield in one fell swoop.
  charSkillDescription:
  - Nergal's attacks leave a Plague, dealing periodic damage. Dashing cures all Plague
    and heals all allies near them.
  - Nergal sweeps their claws, dealing damage and applying Plague to all enemies
    hit.
  - Nergal becomes a cloud of living Plague, becoming invulnerable and leaving Plague
    to all enemies they pass through.
