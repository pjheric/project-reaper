  charBio: "Perhaps always the most battle-ready of the death deities, the Morrigan
    serves as battle mistress for the gods\u2019 different encounters against great
    threats. A Celtic death goddess that encourages her warriors and foretells the
    enemy\u2019s defeat, the Morrigan always has her spear and rallying cries ready
    to turn the tides in her favor. Her lightning fast spear strikes ensure that
    the underworlds never fall to any dark forces and are protected for eternity."
  charSkillDescription:
  - Morrigan gains attack speed based on the number of enemies around her.
  - Morrigan lunges forward with her spear, dealing damage in an area in front of
    her.
  - Morrigan throws her spear, dealing heavy damage to all enemies in a line. Afterwards,
    her passive bonuses are doubled.
