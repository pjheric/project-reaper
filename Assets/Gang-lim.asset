  charBio: A warrior heavily skilled with the blade, Gang-lim was recognized by Yeomra,
    one of many names of the great Yama, after proving his might against the defenders
    of Naraka. Eventually, Gang-lim became a psychopomp, now tasked with protecting
    the dead instead of challenging their many hordes. Though now a stoic and dedicated
    guide, Gang-lim still enjoys being sent to the frontlines when something threatens
    the peace of the underworlds and is one of the most prominent melee warriors
    to this day.
  charSkillDescription:
  - Every third attack, Gang-lim deals bonus damage based on enemy's maximum health.
  - Gang-lim swipes his sword, dealing damage in a wide cone.
  - Gang-lim becomes a tornado, continuously dealing damage over time for 3 seconds
    in a circle.
